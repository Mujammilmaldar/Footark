                    <p>We intend to establish that all sports require excellent fitness of lower limbs as they support their body weight, provide stability, and enable movement. Healthy feet and ankles can improve athletic performance, prevent injuries, and enhance recovery.</p>
                    
                    <p>For example, a runner with healthy feet and ankles can run faster, longer, and more efficiently than a runner with foot or ankle problems. A basketball player with healthy feet and ankles can jump higher, change direction quickly, and land safely without risking sprains or fractures. A soccer player with healthy feet and ankles can kick the ball with more power, accuracy, and control, as well as avoid sliding or tripping on the field.</p>

                <div class="blog-card-body">
                    <p>To prevent or reduce injuries, it is beneficial to do some stretches and exercises that can improve the flexibility, strength, and stability of the feet and ankles. Here are some examples:</p>

                    <h3>1. Toe Raises</h3>
                    <img src="../assets/images/1.webp" style="width:300px;height:175px; margin-bottom: 15px;" class="img-thumbnail">
                    <p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing forward. Slowly lift your toes off the ground while keeping your heels on the floor. Hold for a few seconds and then lower your toes. Repeat 10 times on each foot.</p>

                    <h3>2. Heel Raises</h3>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2.webp" style="width:300px;height:175px; margin-bottom: 15px;" class="img-thumbnail">

                    <p>Sit on a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Lift one foot off the ground and rotate your ankle in a circular motion, clockwise and counterclockwise. Do 10 circles in each direction on each foot.</p>

                    <h3>4. Towel Curls</h3>
                    <img src="../assets/images/4.webp" style="width:300px;height:175px; margin-bottom: 15px;" class="img-thumbnail">
                    <p>Place a small towel on the floor and sit on a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Use your toes to grab the towel and curl it towards you. Then use your toes to push the towel away from you. Repeat 10 times on each foot.</p>

            <!-- Precautions Section -->
            <article class="blog-content-card" id="precautions">
                <div class="blog-card-header">
                    <h2>Precautions</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-card-body">
                    <p>To prevent or reduce the risk of feet and ankle injuries, you should follow some general recommendations:</p>

                    <h3>1. Wear Supportive Shoes</h3>
                    <p>Wear supportive shoes that fit well and are appropriate for your activity. Shoes that are too tight, too loose, or worn out can cause blisters, corns, calluses, or stress fractures. Shoes that have good cushioning, arch support, and stability can protect your feet and ankles from impact and twisting forces.</p>

                    <h3>2. Use Ankle Support</h3>
                    <p>Use an ankle support if you have a history of ankle sprains or instability. Ankle supports can be braces, tapes, or sleeves that provide compression, stability, and proprioception to your ankle joint. They can help prevent excessive inversion or eversion of your ankle, which are the most common causes of ankle sprains.</p>

                    <h3>3. Warm Up Before Activity</h3>
                    <p>Warm up before playing or exercising. Warming up can increase blood flow, oxygen delivery, and flexibility to your muscles, tendons, and ligaments. It can also prepare your nervous system for the demands of your activity. A warm-up should include some light cardio, dynamic stretches, and sport-specific drills.</p>

                    <h3>4. Pay Attention to Surfaces</h3>
                    <p>Pay attention to the play surfaces and the environment. Avoid playing or exercising on uneven, slippery, or hard surfaces that can increase the risk of falls, twists, or impacts. Also, avoid playing or exercising in extreme temperatures or humidity that can affect your hydration, circulation, and performance.</p>

                    <h3>5. Listen to Your Body</h3>
                    <p>Listen to your body and respect your limits. Do not ignore any pain or discomfort in your feet or ankles, as they may indicate an injury or inflammation. Do not push yourself beyond your level of fitness or skill, as this can lead to fatigue, errors, or accidents. Rest when you need to and modify your activity if necessary.</p>

                    <h3>6. Follow Recovery Programs</h3>
                    <p>Prevent recurrent injuries by following a proper recovery and rehabilitation program. If you have had a previous foot or ankle injury, you should consult a doctor or a physiotherapist who can assess your condition and prescribe a treatment plan. This may include rest, ice, compression, elevation, medication, exercises, manual therapy, or surgery. You should follow the instructions and recommendations of your healthcare provider and do not return to your activity until you are fully healed and cleared by them.</p>

                        <p class="blog-quote-text">Feet and ankle injuries can affect your mobility, function, and quality of life.

                    </div>

                    <p>However, if you have any pain or discomfort in your feet or ankles that persists or worsens, you should consult a doctor or a physiotherapist as soon as possible for a proper diagnosis and treatment.</p>
