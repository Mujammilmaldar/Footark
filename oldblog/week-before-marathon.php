<p>So, one most important tip - DO NOT TRY ANYTHING NEW. The purpose of the article is to just guide in terms of</p>
-	relaxing and not overtraining <br>
-	having nutrition that aligns with the body <br>
-	gear preparation<br>
-	avoiding injuries<br><br>

<p> The last week before a marathon is crucial for your performance and well-being. Here are some tips to help you prepare for the big day.</p>
<h3> Physical training:</h3>
<p> There is a reason the week before the marathon is called 'Taper Week.' The last week of training is not the time to push yourself hard or try new workouts. You want to maintain your fitness level, but also allow your body to recover and rest. </p>
-	The general rule is to reduce your mileage by 50% in the last week and do one or two easy runs of 5 to 8 km. Aim for some easy strides or speed bursts to keep your legs fresh.<br>

-	You can also do some light cross-training, such as swimming, cycling, or yoga, but avoid anything that could cause soreness or injury. <br>

-	The day before the marathon, you can do a light jog or walk for 10 to 15 minutes or take a complete rest day. <br><br>

<p>However, the important tip - is not to try exercises that you already are not comfortable with... NO NEW EXERCISE. </p>
<h3>Nutrition: </h3>
<p>Nowadays there are distinct options in terms of energy meals, nutrient bars, and energy drinks being advertised for their utility during marathon training. It may be true (mostly not!).</p>
<p>While we describe what nutrients are required for that marathon finish, we do not suggest you try any new meal plan or dish. Try to get the nutrients from the food your body is accustomed to.</p>

<p>While a balanced diet that provides all nutrients is recommended, Carbohydrates, "the immediate energy store of the human body," is the main fuel for your muscles. Carbohydrate is the main source of fuel for marathon runners, but your body can only store a limited amount of it. When you run out of carbohydrates, your energy levels drop, and your pace slows down. You may even experience the 'wall' - a state where your body has to rely on fat as fuel, which is much harder to convert to energy. </p>
<p>To avoid this, you should increase your carbohydrate intake in the days before your race and consume carbohydrates during the marathon. This will help you maintain your energy and performance throughout the race. </p>
<p>Increase your intake of foods like bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, fruits, and vegetables in the last three days before the marathon. DO NOT OVEREAT - just the composition of the meal be more carb-based. </p>
<p>Avoid any foods that could upset your stomach or cause bloating, gas, or diarrhoea, such as spicy, greasy, or high-fibre foods. Drink plenty of water and electrolyte drinks to stay hydrated and avoid alcohol and caffeine. </p>
<p><b>Sleep Well</b></p>
<h3>Gear preparation:</h3> 
<p>You should have your running outfit (incl. undergarments), shoes, socks, hat, sunglasses, bib number, safety pins, timing chip, and any other accessories ready the night before the marathon.</p> 
<p><b>DO NOT TRY ANYTHING NEW.</b></p>
<p>Make sure everything fits well and is comfortable and familiar. Do not wear anything new or untested on race day, as it could cause chafing, blisters, or discomfort.</p>
<p><b>Shoes</b> - Do a dry dust and grit removal from your shoes. Ensure your insoles are properly set. Check laces and socks to ensure they are not worn out. </p>
<h3>Precautions to avoid injuries: </h3>
<p>You should warm up properly before the start of the race, doing some dynamic stretches and drills to loosen up your muscles and joints. No new stretches or warm-up exercises though. </p>
<p>The whole atmosphere at the marathon is electrifying and it's extremely easy to get impressed with new moves and stretches on display. Trust yourself and your training. The exercises may be good, but you do not want to try something your body is not accustomed to. </p>
<p>If you have any signs of dehydration, heat exhaustion, or heat stroke, such as thirst, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, nausea, or confusion, stop running and seek medical attention immediately. </p> 
<p>Do not take any painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs during the race, as they could mask serious injuries or cause stomach problems. </p>
<p><b>How-to run on race day:</b> Well, you trained for it and if you are at the running site, you are confident enough. Run as you trained. This is not the article to teach that. </p>

<h3>After the race: CHEERS!!!</h3>
<p>Celebrate! It's an achievement to participate in such a demanding event. So be proud of yourself! </p>
<p>You can do some things to recover but if you are a novice, we know you will not bother. Anyway here is the list</p>
-	Cool down gradually by walking for a few minutes and doing some static stretches.<br> 
-	Drink water and electrolyte drinks to replenish your fluids and eat some carbohydrates and protein to restore your energy and repair your muscles. <br>
-	Apply ice or cold compresses to any sore or swollen areas and elevate your legs if possible. <br>
-	If you have any severe pain or swelling that does not improve within a few days, consult a doctor. <br>
