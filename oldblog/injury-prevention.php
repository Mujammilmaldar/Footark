               <p>We urge you to think of any sport (not board games). Think of five. How many need your leg to be agile, strong, flexible.... fit?</p>
<p> If you are anything like us the answer is all 5 - if you are too nerdy; maybe 3 (shooting, archer...). </p>

<p>We intend to establish that all sports require excellent fitness of lower limbs as they support their body weight, provide stability, and enable movement. Healthy feet and ankles can improve athletic performance, prevent injuries, and enhance recovery. </p>
<p> For example, a runner with healthy feet and ankles can run faster, longer, and more efficiently than a runner with foot or ankle problems. A basketball player with healthy feet and ankles can jump higher, change direction quickly, and land safely without risking sprains or fractures. A soccer player with healthy feet and ankles can kick the ball with more power, accuracy, and control, as well as avoid sliding or tripping on the field.</p>
<h3> Injuries</h3>
<p>For being the body part, that is most used, lower limbs are also prone to injuries more than any other part. In fact, knees and feet & ankles are the two most common injury-prone areas among sports personnel.</p>
<p>There are many types of injuries depending on the activity, intensity, and frequency of their training and performance. Here is a list of some of the common foot and ankle injuries in sports, classified into minor and major sections. </p>
<p>(However, do note that these injuries may occur to anyone, and playing any sports may not be the sole reason and this is not an exhaustive list too.)<br><br>
Minor injuries:</p>

    <td>Plantar Fasciitis&ensp;</td>
    <td>&ensp;Heel Spurs</td>
    <td>&ensp;Bunions</td>

<tr>
    <td>Neuromas&ensp;</td>
    <td>&ensp;Sesamoiditis&ensp;</td>

<p>Major injuries:</p>

<p> All of the above injuries are explained separately. The main aim of this article is to highlight the exercises, stretches & precautions which may help sports people have fit legs.</p>

<h3> Stretches And Exercises For Feet And Ankle</h3>
<p> To prevent or reduce injuries, it is beneficial to do some stretches and exercises that can improve the flexibility, strength, and stability of the feet and ankles. Here are some examples:</p>

<img src="images/1.webp" style="width:300px;height:175px;"" class="img-thumbnail"><br>

<p>- Toe raises: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing forward. Slowly lift your toes off the ground while keeping your heels on the floor. Hold for a few seconds and then lower your toes. Repeat 10 times on each foot.</p>
<img src="images/2.webp" style="width:300px;height:175px;"" class="img-thumbnail"><br>
<p>- Heel raises: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing forward. Slowly lift your heels off the ground while keeping your toes on the floor. Hold for a few seconds and then lower your heels. Repeat 10 times on each foot.</p>
<img src="images/3.webp" style="width:300px;height:175px;"" class="img-thumbnail"><br>
<p>- Ankle circles: Sit on a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Lift one foot off the ground and rotate your ankle in a circular motion, clockwise and counterclockwise. Do 10 circles in each direction on each foot.</p>
<img src="images/4.webp" style="width:300px;height:175px;"" class="img-thumbnail"><br>
<p>- Towel curls: Place a small towel on the floor and sit on a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Use your toes to grab the towel and curl it towards you. Then use your toes to push the towel away from you. Repeat 10 times on each foot.</p>
<img src="images/5.webp" style="width:300px;height:175px;"" class="img-thumbnail"><br>
<p>- Resistance band exercises: Wrap a resistance band around the ball of your foot and hold the ends with your hands. Sit on a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Pull the band towards you to flex your foot, then push the band away from you to point your foot. Do 10 repetitions on each foot.</p>
<img src="images/6.webp" style="width:300px;height:175px;"" class="img-thumbnail"><br>
<p>- Toe taps: Sit on a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Tap your toes up and down as fast as you can without lifting your heels off the ground. Do this for 30 seconds on each foot.</p>
<img src="images/7.webp" style="width:300px;height:175px;"" class="img-thumbnail"><br>
<p>- Heel drops: Stand on the edge of a step or a curb with your heels hanging off. Slowly lower your heels below the level of the step or curb, then raise them back up to the starting position. Do 10 repetitions on each foot.</p>
<img src="images/8.webp" style="width:300px;height:175px;"" class="img-thumbnail"><br>
<p>- Calf stretches: Stand facing a wall with one foot in front of the other. Keep both feet flat on the floor and lean forward with your hands on the wall until you feel a stretch in your back leg's calf muscle. Hold for 15 seconds and then switch legs. Do this three times on each leg.</p>
<p> These stretches and exercises can help improve the flexibility, strength, and stability of your feet and ankles. You should do them at least three times a week, preferably before or after physical activity. You should also warm up before doing them and stretch gently afterward. If you feel any pain or discomfort, stop immediately and consult a doctor or a physiotherapist.</p>
<h3>Precautions</h3>
<p To prevent or reduce the risk of feet and ankle injuries, you should follow some general recommendations:</p>
<p>- Wear supportive shoes that fit well and are appropriate for your activity. Shoes that are too tight, too loose, or worn out can cause blisters, corns, calluses, or stress fractures. Shoes that have good cushioning, arch support, and stability can protect your feet and ankles from impact and twisting forces. </p>
<p>- Use an ankle support if you have a history of ankle sprains or instability. Ankle supports can be braces, tapes, or sleeves that provide compression, stability, and proprioception to your ankle joint. They can help prevent excessive inversion or eversion of your ankle, which are the most common causes of ankle sprains. </p>
<p>- Warm up before playing or exercising. Warming up can increase blood flow, oxygen delivery, and flexibility to your muscles, tendons, and ligaments. It can also prepare your nervous system for the demands of your activity. A warm-up should include some light cardio, dynamic stretches, and sport-specific drills. </p>
<p>- Pay attention to the play surfaces and the environment. Avoid playing or exercising on uneven, slippery, or hard surfaces that can increase the risk of falls, twists, or impacts. Also, avoid playing or exercising in extreme temperatures or humidity that can affect your hydration, circulation, and performance. </p>
<p>- Listen to your body and respect your limits. Do not ignore any pain or discomfort in your feet or ankles, as they may indicate an injury or inflammation. Do not push yourself beyond your level of fitness or skill, as this can lead to fatigue, errors, or accidents. Rest when you need to and modify your activity if necessary. </p>
<p>- Prevent recurrent injuries by following a proper recovery and rehabilitation program. If you have had a previous foot or ankle injury, you should consult a doctor or a physiotherapist who can assess your condition and prescribe a treatment plan. This may include rest, ice, compression, elevation, medication, exercises, manual therapy, or surgery. You should follow the instructions and recommendations of your healthcare provider and do not return to your activity until you are fully healed and cleared by them. </p>
<p> Feet and ankle injuries can affect your mobility, function, and quality of life. By following these general recommendations, you can prevent or reduce the risk of foot and ankle injuries and enjoy your physical activities safely and comfortably. </p>
<p> However, if you have any pain or discomfort in your feet or ankles that persists or worsens, you should consult a doctor or a physiotherapist as soon as possible for a proper diagnosis and treatment.
